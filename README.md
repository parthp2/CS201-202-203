# Introduction to Database

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of this course is to understand terms and concept of relational database and NoSQL database. Specifically, we will be learning MySQL and MongoDB.
- **Expectation** Students are expected to have a working computer throughout the semester as we will be implementing programming in database in lecture. This can be a lab computer (with your USB) or your personal computer.
